    <span id="report">OBIS-GBIF Joint Strategy for Marine Biodiversity Data</span>
  description: |      # required
    GBIF and OBIS signed a five-year agreement in 2020 to promote further cooperation across a wide range of activities and services between the two global biodiversity data networks.

    The Letter of Agreement targets both technical collaboration covering data standards, publishing and processing; and institutional collaboration to ensure closer ties between OBIS and GBIF nodes, shared training opportunities and aligned documentation.
